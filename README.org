.dotfiles folder managed by ~stow~ and ~org~.

To propage them all, one can do :

#+begin_src sh
stow -v *
#+end_src

Some parts of this configuration are encrypted with ~org-crypt~ and ~gpg~ for privacy concerns; I can decrypt them and propagate their related files with :

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
emacsclient -ca "" -e "
(view-echo-area-messages)
(org-babel-tangle-file \"~/.dotfiles/emacs/.emacs.d/mail-configuration.org\")"
#+end_src
