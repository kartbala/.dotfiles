.dotfiles folder managed by ~stow~ and ~org~.

To propage them all, one can do :

#+begin_src sh :shebang "#!/bin/sh" :tangle "init.sh"
stow -vRt ~ */
#+end_src

Some parts of this configuration are encrypted with ~org-crypt~ and ~gpg~ for privacy concerns; I can decrypt them and propagate their related files with :

#+begin_src sh :tangle "init.sh"
emacsclient -ca "" -e "(progn
    (let ((file (expand-file-name
    \"emacs/.emacs.d/mail-configuration.org\")))
    (require 'org-crypt)
    (org-babel-tangle-file file)
    (view-echo-area-messages)))"
#+end_src
